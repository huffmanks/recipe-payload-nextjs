        "description": "Homemade gnocchi sounds tricky, but the actual process of making it is pretty easy, and well worth the effort. After boiling, peeling, and mashing some potatoes, you’ll mix them with an egg to make the “dough”. Then comes the fun, soothing part: put on your favorite playlist or podcast while you knead, cut, and add little indentations to every piece. Once they’re done, you simply boil them for 30 seconds and fry up in a decadent butter-sage sauce (or a sauce of your choosing.) Restaurant-level gnocchi accomplished!",
