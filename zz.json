Cover tightly with plastic wrap and microwave on medium (50% power) until the salmon is cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 6 minutes.  We developed and tested the recipe in a 1,000 and 1,250-watt microwave. You may need to cook the salmon for longer, in 1-minute intervals, depending on the power of your microwave and how you like your salmon cooked. Garnish with cilantro and serve scooped over cooked rice.  Did you love the recipe? Leave us a comment below!"
